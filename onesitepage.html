            Spooky, creepy spots in Canberra

 <h1>Blundells Cottage</h1>
  </center>

 <p>
    Blundells Cottage sits on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, beneath the looming ASIO headquarters, so it's spooky in more ways than one.
</p>

 <p>According to Montgomery, items move about inside, and some visitors smell burning flesh which was a throwback to the tragic death of a teenage girl more than a century ago.</p>

 <p>
    "It's Flora Blundell, who [died in the late 1800s] … she was ironing a skirt or a dress," he said.  
 </p>

 <p>
    "She was ironing and it caught fire and it burnt her.
 <center>
    <p>"The story of her is items move around a bit and people smell burning flesh.</p>
    
 </center>

 <p>
    "People say that her presence is more likely to be felt when there's someone there wearing a necklace, because it was said she was wearing a necklace when she died, or caught fire at least."
 </p>

 <p>
    Montgomery said alleged phenomena at the cottage mostly extended to "a presence and a smell".
 </p>

 <p>
    "Although I had a report from 2010 when some people visited the place at night, one of them was looking in a window, and I think they saw a shadow, or a shadow in black get up from a seated position then walk across one of the rooms and turn and face out the window," he said.
 </p>
<p>
    "The person then bolted."
</p>

 <h1>The National Museum (and former Canberra Hospital)</h1>
 </center>

 <p>By far the newest and least obviously creepy building on this list — the National Museum might seem benign, but according to Montgomery it harbours a secret straight out of The Shining.</p>
 
 <center>"There's an old woman that appears in a bathtub but there's no bath tub in that room … she's been seen a number of times," he said.</center>

 <p>
    While this phenomenon is actually in a building a short distance from the Museum, Montgomery said all the alleged happenings appeared linked to the old Canberra Hospital, which used to stand on the site.
 </p>

 <p>
    "There are numerous stories there of a ghostly matron that seemed to be attached to the old hospital," he said.
 </p>

 <P>
    "There's another one... a young boy who seems to be dressed in 1940s-like clothes."

 <h1>
    Hotel Kurrajong 
 </h1>
</center>
<p>
    Hotel Kurrajong has been home to many political figures over the years, none more prominent than Prime Minister Ben Chiffley.
</p>

<p>
One evening in 1951, the then-Prime Minister suffered a fatal heart attack while working in his room — and some say a part of him never left.
</p>
 <p>
    "Is it possible that … his being has sort of been absorbed into that room itself," Montgomery said.
 </p>
 <center>
    <p>
        "He is reported as standing at the windows looking towards Parliament House."   
    </p>
 </center>
<p>
    While Montgomery does believe in ghosts, he describes himself as "highly sceptical".  
</p>
<p>
    "Too many people are too quick to say 'oh it's a ghost'," he said. 
</p>

<p>
    "If you take the example of castles or mansions in England, and they're quite creepy old places … and you have an expectation that something's going to happen." 
</p>

        National Film and Sound Archive
    </center>
</h1>
<p>
    Described by some as "one of Australia's most haunted buildings", the National Film and Sound Archive used to be home to the Australian Institute of Anatomy. 
</p>

<p>
    Its basement contained a morgue, and skeletons used to be on display for attendees to inspect.
</p>

<p>
    When I visited last year, I was almost convinced when a TV light I was carrying mysteriously went out (I later learned there was a logical explanation).  
</p>

<p>
    Others have reported being pinned against walls, or seeing childlike faces peering from behind grates in the NFSA's theatre.
